        <h3> How are drivers matched to trucks?</h3>
        <p>
            Each truck number is assigned to a specific driver. The system automatically groups complaints 
            by both driver and truck for clarity.

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>⚠️ Why are some drivers or trucks flagged?</h3>
        <p>
            If two or more complaints are submitted for the same truck, the system marks that truck 
            and its driver as "Flagged" to indicate repeated issues.

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3> What is the summary report?</h3>
        <p>
            The summary report gives a high-level view of total complaints, driver activity, and complaint 
            statuses, making it easy for supervisors to review patterns.
